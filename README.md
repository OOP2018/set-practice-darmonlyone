* When you print elements in the set, are they in same order as you added them?
       
        No, There are diffrent order
        
* what is the command to remove all elements from a `set`?

        set.clear();
        
* When you add elements in a different order and print them, did the order change?

        Not on HashSet bet yes on TreeSet. On HashSet its diffrent when we put different order but, On TreeSet its the same.
        
* Can you add a duplicate "cat" and "dog" to set?
        
        Cannot added, Because its already contain on Set.
                
* What is the result when you use TreeSet instead of HashSet?

        On HashSet its diffrent when we put different order but, On TreeSet its the same order.
        
* Could we make `setExplorer` work with either Set or List?  How?

        Yes, Becaus Set and List is part of Collection so we just change "Set" to "Collection". Its work!
